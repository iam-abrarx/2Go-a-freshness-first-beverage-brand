    story: `The story of 2Go began with a dream: to make real, preservative-free, and affordable juices accessible to everyone in Bangladesh. The path was not easy. From perfecting recipes to engineering a production system that guarantees hygiene, every step was a challenge. But passion and persistence kept our system running.

Our "North Star" moment happened on our very first day. A customer meticulously asked for every detail about our juice, tasted it, shared it with his wife, and finally gave it to their child. Watching that child smile was the validation we needed—we were serving a purpose, not just a drink.

As demand grew, so did the need for a stronger "brain." Scaling up while preserving quality required us to expand production, strengthen management, and invest heavily in R&D. We treated our operations like a science. Once we validated our standards, we opened opposite Rater Kabab, and later, expanded to Bailey Road. Today, we are ready to scale further, powered by a system that learns, adapts, and delivers excellence.`,
